Top priority upgrades are on top...

> Format SSD to hold 0 partitions before doing partition scheming in 'invoke.sh'
> Encryption with VeraCrypt (also, prompt user for a passphrase).
> Setup LVM.
> Make your own ISO with packages and Atina .git into it.
> Borg backup as systemd service.
> Change volume levels on all devices to '0db' via one bash line (or more lines) (alsamixer).
> Dotfiles deployer; It puts dotfiles in proper places so a user can have customized programs' settings and looks. (Theming...)
> All packages must be FLOSS.
> Check many other OS's and make a good, minimalist package list. Good experience out of the box.
