Make 'green blocks' more descriptive.

Make new testing manual?

Add alacritty.yml for them and for superuser. Difference is 'ttf-iosevka'.

Test user input properly and beautify printing questions.

Sort apps in the better package groups. Rename them?

Read '~/Comparrison.txt' and follow instructions. 
        #.Xauthority ; 'no screens found' xorg # DRIVERS PROBLEM, NVIDIA

Format README.md better.



Make full, upgraded version of 'dwm' and 'st'. 
        'dmenu' is good without any config (compare theirs from site with yours from 'AIFAL.git').
'slstatus' will be replaced with configured polybar. 

Then your work is done...
...and you can start with making art for your OS.
