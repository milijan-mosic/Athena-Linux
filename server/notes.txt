Once passwords and users are setup, make the passwd and shadow files immutable. This may backfire if you authenticate with AD, so decide your authentication method early.
    Files can be made immutable with: $chattr +i $file.

# Securing SSH Server


> $sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

You can secure your OpenSSH server by setting the following options in the sshd_config configuration file:
	X11Forwarding – Enabling X forwarding makes your system vulnerable to X11 related issues. So it’s a good idea to set it to no.
	PermitRootLogin – You should not allow root users to login directly to the system. You should always set it to no.
	Port – change the default port 22 to something non-standard like 9812. It’s a good security practice.

> (e.g.) $ssh -p 888 USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
